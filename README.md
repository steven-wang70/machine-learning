# machine-learning
This repository includes part of my machine learning works in Kaggle competition. I did some clean up to remove those unrequired code.

Most of them are implemented in Keras, but taking Tensorflow as backend. In handwritten digits, there is a small code file which is implemented in Tensorflow.

In the Steeldefect, there are samples of how to create segmentation models and YOLO models using pretrained backbone models such as resnet34 and vgg19. And there is also a sample of how to create python package to be shared with both local training and GCP cloud training.

COULD NOT guarantee every part works. Some code is broken while I was focusing on another part.

I will add my work little by little to this repository, plus some research work.
