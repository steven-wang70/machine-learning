. Redo split files into classes so sample could be used nested.
+ After each training, automatically test its score, true masked, pred masked, their intersection;

. Train only on labeled samples or true samples if possible, together with inter verify such as class 4 with the similar in class 3
. For class 4, 6, try image augmentation by ratating, resizing
